<p>
I am an Assistant Professor at <a href='https://cs.vt.edu'>Virginia Tech</a> (VT), and a Faculty Researcher at <a href='https://research.google'>Google</a>. Prior to joining VT, I held the position of Research Scientist at <a href='https://deepmind.google'>Google DeepMind</a> for a year after receiving my PhD in Computer Science from the <a href='https://www.cics.umass.edu'>University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>, advised by <a href='https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer'>Mohit Iyyer</a>. 
</p>
<p>
My research aims to develop effective and efficient methods for advancing and democratizing artificial intelligence in the era of large language models (LLMs). Specific areas of focus include:
</p>

- <span class="font-weight-bold">Efficient model development:</span> developing techniques to create more powerful LLMs using less computational power and data
- <span class="font-weight-bold">Parameter-efficient transfer learning:</span> efficiently transferring knowledge across tasks, languages, and modalities
- <span class="font-weight-bold">Search engine augmentation:</span> combining LLMs with search engines to improve their factual accuracy and ability to access up-to-date information
- <span class="font-weight-bold">Instruction tuning:</span> enhancing LLMs' instruction-following capabilities
- <span class="font-weight-bold">Advanced reasoning:</span> improving LLMs' ability to solve complex reasoning problems


{% details ⭐: For prospective PhD students %}
<p>
I plan to recruit one or two PhD students every year. If you are interested in joining my group, please <a href='https://applyto.graduateschool.vt.edu/apply'>apply</a> to the VT Graduate School and list me as a potential advisor. Please also check out the <a href='https://cs.vt.edu/Graduate/ApplicationDeadlines.html'>application deadlines</a> and <a href='https://website.cs.vt.edu/Graduate/Prospective.html'>information for prospective students</a>. Due to the high volume of emails I receive, I may not be able to respond to each one individually; please don't be discouraged — I may still review your application.

{% details ⭐: For Undergraduate and Masters students at VT %}
<p>
I am open to collaborating on research with current VT students, ideally those who have at least one full calendar year remaining until graduation. If you are interested, feel free to email me or visit during my office hours.
