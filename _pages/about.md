<p>
I am a Research Scientist at <a href='https://research.google'>Google Research</a> and an incoming Assistant Professor at <a href='https://cs.vt.edu'>Virginia Tech</a>. Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the <a href='https://www.cics.umass.edu'>University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>, advised by <a href='https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer'>Mohit Iyyer</a>. I also spent three years (2020â€“2023) as a research intern/student researcher at <a href='https://deepmind.google'>Google DeepMind</a> and <a href='https://research.google'>Google Research</a>. My research aims to develop effective and efficient methods for advancing and democratizing artificial intelligence in the era of large language models (LLMs).
</p>

<p>
My current research focuses on addressing limitations of LLMs and developing novel learning paradigms. Specific areas of focus include:
</p>

- <span class="font-weight-bold">In-context learning and tool-use LLMs:</span> injecting knowledge into LLM prompts and augmenting LLMs with external tools
- <span class="font-weight-bold">Instruction tuning:</span> enhancing LLMs' instruction-following capabilities
- <span class="font-weight-bold">Parameter-efficient transfer learning:</span> efficiently transferring knowledge across tasks, languages, and modalities
- <span class="font-weight-bold">Few-shot learning:</span> learning from limited labeled data
